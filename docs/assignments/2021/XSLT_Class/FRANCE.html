         <p><span class="parNum">1</span>Took a <span class="transport">motor</span> from travel agency-after breakfast in our fancy round sitting room. Drove all
            around <span class="place">Paris</span> the driver named Harvey had a daughter named at <span class="place">Waycross Georgia</span>. Went to
            <span class="place">Lubin's</span> for perfrume (had the pink flannel affair that Harriet had given me- REsented') W
            alked around the circle- <span class="place">Place de Vandome</span> to
            <span class="place">Caron</span>, <span class="place">The Ritz Hotel</span>, and a <span class="place">jewellers</span>
            where I was intregued by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in
            the <span class="place">Bois</span> for lunch <span class="place">Le Pre Catalan</span>. Went then to both sides of the <span class="place">Sien</span> and got some little
            prints of <span class="place">Paris</span>. <span class="place">R.R. station</span> and <span class="place">Tourist Agencyreg</span>. tickets. We had our evening meal at the
            <span class="place">Bristol</span> and then set out for the <span class="place">Casion deParis</span>. Very amusing show- we stayed thro'
            half of it but felt we needed sleep. Gail got a <span class="transport">cab</span> by her shrill
            whistle!"</p>
         <p><span class="parNum">3</span> <span class="date">July 26, 1955</span> <span class="place">Brussles</span> - Dear People: We are just about to
            take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
            intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
            the <span class="transport">boat</span>.
            We arrived in <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="transport">train</span> to find that it was over 90. We nearly
            died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very unairconditioned <span class="transport">train</span> and blazing sun. The first thing we
            did when we arrived at <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for dinner later and
            cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and
            guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
            breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the <span class="place">Left
               Bank</span>, got <span class="transport">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I
            must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
            we
            were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior
               Bercheron</span>, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
            for lunch and got in a little <span class="transport">car</span> and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
            <span class="place">chateaux</span>. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
            their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
            dinner we
            went to a nearby <span class="place">chateau</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like <span class="place">fairyland</span>. They
            also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
            told the
            history of the <span class="place">building</span>. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and
            their little boy and ourselves went on another <span class="place">chateaux</span> trip which was just a grand as the
            day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
            thing
            that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
            told it
            in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
            was on my
            side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
            on but I
            nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
            eleven
            and got back in <span class="place">Paris</span> for lunch. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
            shopping. </p>
