#Having a tough time getting source and text to be green. 
#At one point, the block was good and green.
#But you know what they say...It's not easy being green. 

#ebb: The problem here is that you haven't defined a rule for note,
# which is the last element on your list of the contents of <source>.
# I think once you fix that you'll be okay! 

# ebb: However(!) You're defining lots of things to be empty in the following
# rules. You only want to use empty for elements that have NO text content,
# and yet clearly you do want text for most of these. You can just take out
# empty in most of these cases, after comparing to what you see in the XML.
# An empty element just looks like this: 
# <date when="2021-09-27"/>  It can have attributes, but not text inside.
