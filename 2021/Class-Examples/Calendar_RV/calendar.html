         Two rooms of a house are drawn; the upstairs, which has a mother (Mary), her husband (can't remember his name), and a child (Warren). Meanwhile, two people are downstairs, and they appear to be playing pool. The upstairs
         and downstairs rooms are clearly labelled, and ironically, are the easiest things
         to read besides the date and copyright information.

         This is one of the few pages written entirely in pencil. Unfortunately, this means
         that it isn't very clear to read. From what little I can gather, Mary's family had
         the roof of their house redone and ordered a billiard/pool table, and either her husband
         or someone they know loves to play pool.

         This one is interesting: there are two cutouts from articles, with one containing
         a drawing of a large woman and a small man with some text underneath with while the
         second cutout only consists of text. It is unknown where it came from.

         I took care to transcribe the printed text in the images. I couldn't read what was
         entirely in pencil, but I got most of it. It sounds like she hasn't had Warren yet,
         so she is worried about her weight and is reading up on skin-care.

         Someone (possibly Mary) is tending to a man's hair. She appears to be rubbing in shampoo ( or "scalp food",
         as she called it) and the woman appears to be singing or talking. The image is drawn
         in pencil and what appears to be watercolor, with the woman's hair obscuring the year
         number.

         I wonder: if this is Mary, did she cut and clean her husband's hair? Was she at a hairdresser waiting to have
         her hair done and saw this when she was waiting? Did they have a housekeeper of some
         kind? I have so many questions.

         An infant is seen from behind. Looking closely, the
         image was made with a different type of paper. It was likely first printed in a magazine,
         cut
         out, and glued onto the page.

            <br/><span class="lineNum">29</span>That little spot in the

         It's clear that Mary is talking about her son Warren here. From the way she
         talks about him, he is a few months old (or less) and she absolutely adores him.
         If Warren is her first born child, then her joy from being around him makes a lot
         more sense.

         A basket of fruits and vegetables is drawn using pencil and watercolor. The pencil
         is faded, but surprisingly legible.

            <br/><span class="lineNum">38</span>Here's a basket of things from

          I don't know if Becker has been mentioned before, but he appears he is a close friend of the Behrends. I
         remember that around this time more people were encouraged to start gardens (If I
         am remembering correctly), and Maryoffering fresh fruits and vegetables to someone, friend or neighbor, was a sign of
         goodwill.

         An anthropomorphic peach or tomato lady is on the left of the page and a pear lady
         is drawn on the right. They are made with pencil and watercolor, and the text is about
         them.

          I can tell, from reading enough pages, that Warren has already been born. Since he's a young child, I wouldn't be surprised if Mary tried writing little stories to read to her son. It's almost like something out of
         a children's book, and it reminds me of some of the books I had read to me when I
         was young.

          This is one of the most bizarre calendar pages out of the collection. It's one of,
         if not, the only page that doesn't have a drawing or photo on it. I wonder if she
         couldn't think of anything to draw. Maybe she didn't have time, or maybe this quote
         inspired her. Who knows?

         There is a photo of two men and two women walking down a street, with two other people
         walking in the background. Everyone in the foreground is wearing black, while everyone
         in the background is dressed in brighter colors.

          I can't read everything, but it appears this was written after attending a funeral
         or recently losing a loved one. Unfortunately, I can't make out most of her handwriting
         here, and I wonder if that's her in the picture.

         This is either a bunch of rabbits hopping together or one rabbit moving really quickly.
         Don't know for sure.

          This is a stark contrast from the previous page; it was somber, likely from losing
         someone close, and now she's drawn something silly about rabbits, a common "game"
         animal. Maybe she knew someone who was hunter, since rabbit are common game animals
         when they are not being kept as pets.
