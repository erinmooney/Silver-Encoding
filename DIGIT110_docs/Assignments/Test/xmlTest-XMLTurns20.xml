        <quote source="Beatles"><p>“It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band to    <!--edm: missing ending <p> tag-->
            play..."</p></quote>. Actually, it was <duration quantity="21.5" unit="year">21½ years ago  <!--edm: missing "" with attributes-->    
                today</duration> that <persName>Jon Bosak</persName> pulled together the original
            <orgName>XML Working Group</orgName>. But yes, it was <event>on <date

                released to the world</event>. Which is worth talking about.
        <p>It turns out that if you follow the pointers back, the original <codeSpec>XML 1.0
            Specification</codeSpec> is still out there &amp; <rs type="person" ref="Bray_Tim">my           <!--edm: / at the back instead of front in ending tag. The & sign also needs to be written as &amp;-->
                fingers</rs> were the last to touch that document. The history of how XML came to be        <!--edm: ending <rs> tag missing /-->
            has been told at great length elsewhere, as have the details about <date
                when="1998-02-10">that February 10th</date>, so there’s no need to revisit.</p>
        <p>
