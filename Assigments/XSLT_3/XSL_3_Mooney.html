MONTAGE OF A DREAM DEFERRED



Dream Boogie


Good morning, daddy!
Ain't you heard
The boogie-woogie rumble
Of a dream deferred?


Listen closely;
You'll hear their feet
Beating out and beating out a-


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You think</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's a happy beat?</em>


Listen to it closely;
Ain't you heard
something underneath
like a-


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What did I say?</em>


Sure,
I'm happy!
Take it away!


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hey, pop!</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Re-bop!</em>

Parade


Seven ladies
and seventeen gentlemen
at the Elks Club Lounge
planning planning a parade:
Grand Marshal in his white suit
will lead it.
Cadilacs with dignitaries
will precede it.
And behind will come
with band and drum
on foot... on foot...
on foot...


Motorcycle cops,
white,
will speed it
out of sight
if they can;
Solid black,
can't be right.


Marching... marching...
marching...
noon till night...


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I never knew</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">that many Negroes</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></em>were on earth,

Children's Rhymes


When I was a chile we used to play,
One-two-buckle my shoe!
and things like that. But now, Lord,
listen at them little varmints!


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By what sends</em>

<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></em>then white kids

Sister


That little Negro's married and got a kid.
Why does he keep on foolin' around Marie?
Marie's my sister-not married to me-
But why does he keep on foolin' around Marie?
Why don't she get a boy-friend
I can understand-some decent man?


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Did it ever occur to you, son,</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">the reason Marie runs around with trash</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">is she wants some cash?</em>


Don't decent folks have dough?




Sister

<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately usually no!</em>


Well, anyway, it don't have to be a married man.


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Did it ever occur to you, boy,</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">that a woman does the best she can?</em>


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comment on Stoop</em>


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So does a man.</em>


Preference


I likes a woman
six or eight and ten years older'n myself.
I don't fool with these young girls.
Young girl'll say,
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daddy, I want so-and-so.</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I needs this, that, and the other.</em>
But a old woman'll say,
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Honey, what does YOU need?</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I just drawed my money tonight</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and it's all your'n</em>
That's why I likes a older woman
who can appreciate me:
When she conversations you
it ain't forever, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gimme!</em>



Necessity


Work?
I don't have to work.
I don't have to do nothing
but eat, drink, stay black, and die.
This little old furnished room's
so small I can't whip a cat
without getting fur in my mouth
and my landlady's so old
her features us all run together
and God knows she sure can overcharge-
Which is why I reckon I does
have to work after all.


Question


<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Said the lady, Can you do</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">what my other man can't do-</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That is</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">love me, daddy-</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and feed me, too?</em>

 Buddy


That kid's my buddy,
still and yet
I don't see him much.
He works downtown for Twelve a week.
Has to give his mother Ten-
she says he can have
the other Two
to pay his carfare, buy a suit,
coat, shoes,
anything he wants out of it.


Juke Box Love Song


I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day-
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.



Ultimatum


Baby, how come you can't see me
when I'm paying your bills
each and every week?


If you got somebody else,
tell me-
else I'll cut you off
without your rent,
I mean
without a cent.


Warning


Daddy,
don't let your dog
curb you!


 Croon


I don't give a damn
For Alabam'
Even if it is my home.


New Yorkers


I was born here,
that's no lie, he said,
right here beneath God's sky.

She lifted up her lips

Easy Boogie


Down in the bass
That steady beat
Walking walking walking
Like marching feet.





Movies


The Roosevelt, Renaissance, Gem, Alhambra:
Harlem Laughing in all the wrong places
at the crocodile tears

that you know

(Hollywood

black--
so I laugh
back.)





Tell Me


Why should it be<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">my</em>loneliness,
Why should it be<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">my</em>song,
Why should it be<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">my</em>dream
deferred
overlong?




Not a Movie


Well, they rocked him with road-apples
because he tried to vote
and whipped his head with clubs
and he crawled on his knees to his house
and he got the midnight train
and he crossed that Dixie line
now he's livin'
on a 133rd.


He didn't stop in Washington
and he didn't stop in Baltimore
neither in Newark on the way.
Six knots was on his head
but, thank God, he wasn'r dead!
And there ain't no Ku Klux
on a 133rd

Motto


I play it cool
And dig all jive.
That's the reason
I stay alive.


My motto,
As I live and learn,
is:
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dig and Be Dug</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Return</em>





Dead in There


Sometimes
A night funeral
Going by
Carries home
A cool bop daddy.


Hearse and flowers
Guarantee
He'll never hype
Another paddy.


It's hard to believe,
But dead in there,
He'll never lay a
Hype nowhere!


He's my ace-boy,
Gone away.
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wake up and live!</em>
He used to say.


Squares
Who couldn't dig him,
Plant him now--
Out where it makes
No diff' no how.




Situation


When I rolled three 7's
in a row
I was scared to walk out
with the dough.





Dancer


Two or three things in the past
failed him
that had not failed people
of lesser genius.


In the first place
he didn't have much sense.
He was no good at making love
and no good at making money.
So he tapped,
trucked,
boogied,
sanded,
jittered,
until he made folks say,
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looky yonder</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">at that boy!</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hey!</em>
But being no good at lovin'--
the girls left him.
(When you're no good for dough they go.)
With no sense, just wonderful feet,
What could possibly be all-reet?
Did he get anywhere? No!


Even a great dancer
can't C.P.T.
a show.





Advice


Folks, I'm telling you,
birthing is hard
and dying is mean--
so get yourself
a little loving
in between.




Green Memory


A wonderful time--the War:
when money rolled in
and blood rolled out.
But blood
was far away
from here--
Money was near.




Wine-O


Setting in the wine-house
Soaking up a wine-souse
Waiting for tomorrow to come--
Then
Setting in the wine-house
Soaking up a new souse.
Tomorrow...
Oh, hum!





Tomorrow


Tomorrow may be
a thousand years off

But the people will forget --
Except on holidays.

Nothing at all named after John Brown.

When a chile gets to be thirteen

Hail, Mary, mother of God!

<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Swing low, sweet chariot,</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coming for to carry me home.</em>


Sunday morning where the rhythm flows,
how old nobody knows --
yet old as mystery,
older than creed,
basic and wondering
and lost as my need.

Testimonial


If I just had a piano,
if I just had a organ,
if I just had a drum,
how I could praise my Lord!


But I don't need no piano,
neither organ

for to praise my Lord




Passing


On sunny summer Sunday afternoons in Harlem
when the air is one interminable ball game
and grandma cannot get her gospel hymns
from the Saints of God in Christ
on account of the Dodgers on the radio,





Passing


on sunny Sunday afternoons
when the kids look all new
and far too clean to stay that way,
and Harlem has its
washed-and-ironed-and-cleaned-best out,
the ones who've crossed the line
to live downtown
miss you,
Harlem of the bitter dream
since their dream has
come true.




Nightmare Boogie


I had a dream
and I could see
a million faces
black as me!
A nightmare dream:

<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All them faces</em>
<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turned dead white|</em>
Boogie-woogie,
Rolling bass,
Whirling treble
of cat-gut lace.

I feel like dancin', baby,
till the sun goes down.


But I wonder where
the sunrise
Monday morning's gonna be?


I feel like dancin'!
Baby, dance with me!

Some folks blame high prices on the Jews.
(Some folks blame too much on Jews.)
But in Harlem they don't answer back,
Just maybe shrug their shoulders,
"What's the use?"
What's the use

What's the use?
What's the Harlem?

Throat sometimes.
